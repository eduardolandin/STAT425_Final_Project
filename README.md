# STAT425 Final Project
Determinants of County-Level COVID Incidence

## We wanted to answer the following questions:
* What is the relationship between a countyâ€™s population and its per capita COVID 19 case counts?
* To what extent can mask survey data and election outcomes be used to predict per capita COVID 19 case counts?

## In order to answer these questions we decided to take 2 separate approaches
* A Bayesian hierarchical model where counties were assigned to groups according to their population
* A Bayesian regression model that used mask and election data as predictors
* The two R files in this repository include the code necessary to generate both models, as well as data for cross-validation, data wrangling, and other miscellaneous purposes.
